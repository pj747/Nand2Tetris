# Nand2Tetris
Nand2Tetris is available for everyone at https://www.nand2tetris.org/
This is my output of taking up the project as a part of an FCSD course.
I have divided the solution into two halves, rather than 12 projects.

1. Hardware Descriptions
    - The first half of the project uses a custom HDL to create a simple computer based on the HACK architecture.
I have added all the HDL files created as a part of this.

2. Software Suite
    - The second half of the project requires the creation of an assembler, virtual machine translator and a compiler.
The compiler is designed with the aim of abstracting away implementation - each grammar rule is implemented very close to the actual syntactical definition.
